#  Project Portfolio Management System -> Frontend
Project Portfolio Management System is a project developed during the Software Project for the Software Project at Delft University of Technology for the Computer Graphics and Visualization Course.

The purpose of the app is to store finished projects so that they can be nicely displayed and easily shared, referenced to future employers or just stored.

A full [Documentation](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse2000-software-project/2023-2024/cluster-b/02a/docs/-/blob/document-add/README.md?ref_type=heads) of the usage and available options of Project Portfolio Management System is available on the wiki. For help on the most common questions, please refer to the FAQ document.

Today, Project Portfolio Management System is used as a publishing project platform by users worldwide.

This section is dedicated to the frontend part of the application.

## Running the application (frontend)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. By executing this command the frontend part of the application will start working an can be accessed from the hosting server. Remember that the backend should also be running so that the application can fully work. More info about running the backend on the [wiki](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse2000-software-project/2023-2024/cluster-b/02a/backend/-/blob/main/README.md?ref_type=heads) .

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
